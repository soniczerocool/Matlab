Hi ,
Here is a list of the files contained in RLS.zip 
FIR_RLS : FIR RLS demo (FIR is used when there is an access to the output ; i.e feedback is used like in a dc motor we use speed as feedback)
IIR_RLS : IIR RLS demo (IIR is used when there is no access to the output ; the system model is only a function of the input i.e channel equalization prolbem ) 
FIRsampledata : a sample data for FIR RLS demo
IIRsampledata : a sample data for IIR RLS demo

Enjoy !
